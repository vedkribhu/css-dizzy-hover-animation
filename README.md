This showcases a simple effect where the text of the Apple logo is styled to look like it's spinning.

The effect is achieved by replacing each letter with a div that contains spans for each character. When a character is hovered, the opacity of all characters is reduced to create the dizzy effect.

This vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solution depicts how modularization can be achieved without any libraries or frameworks.

The solution is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://css-dizzy-hover-animation.vercel.app/)
